				<p>We are foreign exchange and international payments specialists with many years experience in banking.  In the last few years, we have watched with interest as bank and non-bank providers have changed the way they advertise their services.  From the largest banks to the most aggressive fintechs, the message is always the same - transparent charges and better rates.  
</br></br>
But there’s a problem - many are misleading you and you have no way of verifying what you’ve been told.  In fact, some of the providers who are most vocal about how you’ve been getting ripped off until they came along are often the most misleading of all.  How do they get away with it?  Easily, because it’s almost impossible for consumers or corporates to verify what they have actually been charged for an international payment.  This is due to the way that the foreign exchange market works.  We’ve provided more information about the issue here. 
</br></br>
We developed Trace FX to enable anyone, from a retail consumers to corporate Treasurers, to understand and verify what they’ve been charged for international payments.  This will enable you to keep your provider honest and, if appropriate, seek financial redress for any overcharging and / or choose a better provider.  And maybe, one day, real-world practice for international payments will catch up to the PR and marketing.  
</br></br>
As you will discover using this tool, the more detailed the information you input, specifically about the time you executed your international payment, the more accurate the result will be.  The more accurate the result, the better equipped you will be to deal with any over-charging, negotiate a better deal in future and / or to assess alternative providers.  If you only know the date you executed an international payment and not the time it will be harder to spot over-charging, though not necessarily impossible, and you will not know exactly what you paid. 
</br></br>
We don’t charge for the tools available on this site and we are not affiliate marketers.  We do, however, offer industrial strength tooling and professional support if you make a large volume of international payments.  If you would like to discuss this, please get in touch.

        			<h2>How banks and fintechs make money from international payments (and why it’s hard for you to verify how much they have charged)</h2>
        			<h3>Typically, banks and fintechs make money from international payments in two ways.</h3>
        		</div>
				
				<p>
<h4>Payment Fees:</h4> The first is through a payment fee.  This is a fixed amount per payment, for example £20.  The fee varies depending on the payment infrastructure used, for example the SWIFT network or the local payment infrastructure.  Although the fees for a SWIFT payment tend to be higher than the fees for a local payment, the payment fee does not necessarily reflect the actual cost of processing the payment.
</br></br>
Many providers, particularly non-banks, advertise 0% commission or zero fees.  Others offer to waive the fee if you are sending a minimum amount - say, £3000.  0% commissions and zero fees can be particularly misleading, as will become clear when we discuss the second way these providers make money.  In fact, it is a mystery to many in the industry why the FCA in the UK, and regulators in other jurisdictions, do not take any action against this blatant miss-selling and failure to treat customers fairly.  It’s not like the people who work at the FCA don’t see these ads - they catch the tube, read the newspaper, travel through airports and walk down high streets too.  
</br></br>
The second is through the foreign exchange rate applied to your international payment.  For most providers, this is where they make most of their money.  This is why they offer 0% commissions and zero fees.  It’s also why it so misleading when they advertise, to retail customers who do not understand foreign exchange, that their service is being provided at 0% commission or zero fee.  It’s not hard to see why they offer 0% commission when they can simply take a bigger margin on the foreign exchange rate which is much less visible to the customer.
</br></br>
Before we move onto how providers make money off the foreign exchange rate, it’s worth understanding another aspect of the 0% commission or zero fee proposition.  When the provider is using the SWIFT network, the sender can designate whether (i) they pay the fee, (ii) the receiver (known as the beneficiary) pays the fee, or (iii) the fee is shared.  Some providers tell the customer that they will not charge a fee but ‘other banks may charge a fee’.  In such cases, the provider has simply designated that the beneficiary will pay the fee (without telling you) and the receiving bank will simply deduct the fee from the final amount received.  This is misleading and the customer inevitably finds that less money arrives than they intended.  It also means you do not know how much will be charged, which is a significantly worse experience than a provider who clearly states and charges you the fee up front.
</br></br></br>
<h4>Foreign Exchange Rates:</h4> The second way that providers make money from international payments is by applying a margin to the foreign exchange (FX) rate.  Some providers clearly state what margin they will apply (usually expressed as a percentage, say 0.75%) though most do not.  
</br></br>
There are a number of reasons why it is hard for customers to verify that the correct margin has been applied (if the provider stated the margin in advance) or to know what margin was applied at all (if the provider did not state the margin in advance), but the main reason is that FX rates move in real time and may change by over 1% in a day.  If you know what the interbank FX rate was at the time you initiated your international payment, you can check the difference between the interbank FX rate and the FX rate that was used to process your payment.  This would enable you to determine what margin the provider actually applied.  The problem for most customers is that they don’t know what the ‘official’ FX rate was at the time that they initiated their international payment.  Most services that publish historic FX rates simply publish one FX rate for the day.  This might be the rate at the end of the trading day or at another specific time of day, or might be a daily average or some other calculation.  As FX rates move in real time 24 hours per day 5.5 days per week, it is hard for you to know what the ‘official’ rate was at the time you initiated your payment.

        			<h2>What about mid-rates (which we hear so much about)?</h2>
        			
        		</div>
				
				<p>There are providers who make statements such as ‘there is only one real FX rate and it’s the mid-rate’ and, ‘if your provider is not using a mid-rate, you are being ripped off.’  This is false and we can only assume they know so.  Or they don’t know anything about foreign exchange.  We’re not sure which would be worse in a foreign exchange provider.  
</br></br>
The foreign exchange market is based on bids and offers.  A market participant will buy USD from you at Rate 1 (the bid), or sell USD to you at Rate 2 (the ask).  The difference between Rate 1 and Rate 2 is known as the spread.  You can see that an FX broker can buy at a lower price and sell to you at a higher price.  The spread is both a risk management tool to make sure the dealer does not make a loss in a market moving in real time and a profit margin.  It is possible to determine a theoretical mid-point between Rate 1 and Rate 2, which is called a mid-rate, but you cannot go into the foreign exchange market and trade a a mid-rate.  There are only bids and offers and, for the reasons just given, there is a spread between them (even that spread gets very small for some major liquid currency pairs).  
</br></br>
It is possible for your provider to apply the margin they have quoted to a mid-rate.  This is, however, just a theoretical way of establishing the final rate given to you.  The provider itself will not be trading on a mid-rate when it covers its position (which we suppose answers the question about whether they know it’s misleading to state that the only real rate is the mid-rate).        
</br></br>

        			<h2>So, why is it hard for you to verify what you have been charged?</h2>
        		</div>
				
				<p>
As discussed above, foreign exchange is an over the counter market, so theoretically every market participant could be applying a different rate.  To get the best picture of what the foreign exchange rate is at any given time, therefore, professional market data providers such as Reuters and Bloomberg receive rates from many market participants and, using their own algorithms, generate a blended market rate.  This is often referred to as the interbank rate because the underlying rates are primarily bids and offers submitted by banks.  These are the rates that they buy from and sell to each other and constitute the wholesale market.      
</br></br>
The big difficulty is that you need to know the interbank rate at the time that you initiated your international payment.  If you know this, you can easily calculate the difference between the interbank rate (the wholesale price) and the rate that you were given.  This enables you to calculate the margin applied by the provider and, if you wish, what you paid in monetary germs (ie the margin times the amount you sent or received).  
</br></br>
Unfortunately, most publicly available rate sources usually provide a single rate for the whole day, which may be the rate at the end of the trading day in a particular city, an average of the daily high and low or some other rate.  As the foreign exchange market moves in real time, this does not tell you the market rate at the time you initiated your international payment.  As such, you cannot determine what foreign exchange margin was applied.     
</br></br>
Note that there are one or two websites that offer a tool for calculating he margin but only use a daily rate.  They may tell you that this is sufficient, but in truth it leaves you with no real idea of the margin.  It is sufficient for their use because they are simply affiliate marketing sites.
